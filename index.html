    <p><em>Salutations, All!</em> My name is SGT Collins soon to be Trevon.  I'm
    beyond excited to begin this course and the only reason my webpage isn't
    spicy is because I'm on a time crunch.</p>

    <h2>Five Things I Enjoy</h2>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Being a Dad! Every aspect of being a parent is motivating and
      I don't put anything before it.</li>
      <li>IT in its entirety.  I have always been interested in computer
      networking, computer hardware, and software.  Last year during my
      deployment to Romania was the first time I actually got into programming.
    </li>
      <li>Automotive repair and maintenance. One of my favorite hobbies is
        to diagnose and fix issues with vehicles and resale them.
      </li>
      <li>Long walks near water fronts.  This is probably the most relaxing
      and invigorating task I do.  I always feel relieved and recharged
      afterwards.</li>
      <li>Achieving goals.  Without setting goals and achieving them, or taking
        every possible step to do so, life seems to have little purpose.</li></p>
        
    <h2>Closing Statemnt</h2>
    <p>I look forward to learning and conquering the challanges of this
        course and applying my skills to solving real world issues afterwards.</p>
    </ul>
