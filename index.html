          <p><em>Salutations, All!</em> My name is Trevon.  My introduction to web devolpment
          began on March 1, 2021 through a Cohort "VetsWhoCode" hosted by Jerome Powell
          ... Jerome Hardaway I meant.  One gives me money(with assistance from his constituents) and the latter teaches me skills 
          to get money so I get them confused sometimes.  Nonetheless, lets get into it. Here's a few details about me.</P>
            
          <p>I'm a Dad first! Every aspect of being a parent is motivating and
          I don't put anything before it.</p>

          <p>Computer science in its entirety is one of the most intriguing things to me.  I have 
            always been interested in the ins and outs of computers, how they function, the hardware 
            associated with it, etc. Once I started trading cryptocurrency for capital gains 
            at the beginning of 2019, something sparked inside of me to start researching what exactly 
            cryptocurrnecy is and where its value comes from.  This is when I became submerged in the blockchain finanza
            and my spark that I had in college was revived.</p> 
          
          <p>I attended James Sprunt Community College, immediately after graduating high school in 2010, 
            where I earned my Associates degree in applied sciences.  I graduated in 2014 in which I started my own used
            automotive business and repair shop with the help of my Father.  This shift was due to troubles finding an entry 
            level job along with my passion for the automotive world.  Now I'm looking at the two and realizing that Without
            programming the computers used in automobiles, or without the computer at all, we would not have fuel injected vehicles,
            we wouldn't have digital gauges, we wouldn't see machine learning building data for Tesla's autopilot.</p>
          
          <p>Over the years I've learned there's nothing we can possibly do to control every aspect of life.  We can prepare and control how we 
            react to unintended situations.  To prepare or woosah I like to go on long walks near water fronts or at a park, 
            hit the gym, or simply meditate in a quiet location... just to name a few methods that usually work.</p>
